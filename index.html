      <h1>Evolution</h1>
      <p>The real "creation" story...</p>
      <p>Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago</p>
      <p>Life began as early as 3.7 billion years ago</p>
      <p>Current estimate is there are 8.7 million species</p>
      <p>7.77 million of these are species of animals</p>

      <p>Mammals 320 million years ago</p>
      <p>Primates 85 million years ago</p>
      <p>Humans and chimpanzees separated 7.5 million years ago</p>
      <p>Homo sapiens somewhere between 250000 - 400000 years ago</p>
      <p>Humans have existed for less than 1% of 1% of the journey of life</p>

      <h1>Darwin</h1>
      <p>Less than 1% of 1% of the human journey, we began to understand our origins</p>
      <p>Darwin unfolded our creation story and showed that all beings were inter-related</p>
      <p>We share around 50% of our genetic makeup with plants</p>
      <p>We share 99% of our genetic makeup with bonobos and chimpanzees</p>
      <p>We probably helped extinct our closer hominin relatives</p>
      <p>We share DNA remnants from at least two other hominin ancestors, neanderthal and denisova</p>

    <section data-background-image="./images/michelangelo-creazione-di-adamoe.jpg" id="religion">
      <h1>Religious myopism</h1>
      <p>The earth and everything in it created for humans (no mention of other hominin species)</p>
      <p>Earth is just a staging ground for the "true" reality in the after life</p>
      <p>Human life is either the highest, or the only meaningful life</p>
      <p>Most major faiths - Only humans have an immortal soul</p>
      <p>Other major faiths - Human males are the highest form of being before divinity</p>

    <section data-background-image="./images/science.jpg" id="science">
      <h1>Science</h1>
      <p>Human exceptionalism little different to religious ideas</p>
      <p>Obsession with the separation of humans from all other animals</p>
      <p>Hubris - inability to understand its own limitations</p>
      <p>Glossing over of the huge environmental problems it has caused</p>
      <p>Historical indifference to the rights of other animals</p>
      <p>Still...scientific method our best tool for understanding reality</p>
