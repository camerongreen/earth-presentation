      <p>The real "creation" story...</p>
      <p>Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago</p>
      <p>Life began as early as 3.7 billion years ago</p>
      <p>Current estimates are 8.7 million species</p>

      <p>Humans and chimpanzees separated 7.5 million years ago</p>
      <p>Homo sapiens somewhere between 250000 - 400000 years ago</p>

      <h1>Darwin</h1>
      <p>Less than 1% of 1% of the human journey, we began to understand our origins</p>
      <p>Darwin unfolded our creation story and showed that all beings were inter-related</p>
      <p>We share around 50% of our genetic makeup with plants</p>
      <p>We share 99% of our genetic makeup with bonobos and chimpanzees</p>
      <p>We probably helped extinct our closer hominin relatives</p>
      <p>We share DNA remnants from at least two other hominin ancestors, neanderthal and denisova</p>

      <h1>Religious narcissism</h1>
      <p>The earth and everything in it created for humans (no mention of other hominin species)</p>
      <p>Human life is either the highest, or the only meaningful life</p>
      <p>Most major faiths - Only humans have an immortal soul</p>
      <p>Other major faiths - Human males are the highest form of being before divinity</p>
      <p>Earth is just a staging ground for the "true" reality in the after life</p>

      <h1>Secular narcissism</h1>
      <p>Athiests have maintained many of the core concepts of religion</p>
      <p>Killing god brought us little or no closer to other species</p>
      <p>Human life still generally considered the only meaningful life</p>
      <p>While a civilising influence has not led to a dramatic change in values</p>

      <h1>Scientific narcissism</h1>
      <p>Scientific method our best tool for understanding reality but...</p>
      <p>Human exceptionalism in science resembles religious ideas</p>
      <p>Obsession with the separation of humans from all other animals</p>
      <p>Hubris - inability to understand its own limitations</p>
      <p>Glossing over of the huge environmental problems it has caused</p>
      <p>Historical indifference to the interests of other life</p>

      <p>Extinction of species at least 1000 times the "natural" rate</p>
      <p>1 in 4 mammals at risk of extinction</p>
      <p>Less than 90% of large fish remain in oceans since 1950</p>
      <p>Less than 40% of all wildlife in last 50 years</p>
      <p>Using resources of 1.5 planets every year</p>

      <h1>Oppression</h1>
      <p>56 billion farm animals killed in the factory farming system each year</p>
      <p>Untold numbers of sea creatures - only counted in tonnage</p>
      <p>We kill more animals every day than humans who were killed in all wars of the entire 20th century</p>
      <p>Branding, dehorning, castrating, detailing, debeaking, all routine</p>
      <p>115 million animals used in experiments worldwide</p>
      <p>Mass refusal to acknowledge the problem or even engage with issue</p>
